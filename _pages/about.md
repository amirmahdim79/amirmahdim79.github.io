I'm dedicated! j'apprends le fran√ßais depuis plus d'un an!

## Who am I?

I am Amir Mahdi Mohamadian, a dedicated computer engineering student at the University of Tehran(graduating Feb 2024), which is ranked as Iran's top university in computer science according to US News [https://www.usnews.com/education/best-global-universities/iran/computer-science].

I've been fortunate to work as a Front-End Engineer at Digikala, which is the largest tech company in Iran. Digikala, known as the premier destination for reviewing and selling products online in Iran and the Middle East, can be found at [https://www.digikala.com/].

Currently, I serve as the enthusiastic team leader of the Front-End Chapter at Teamyab, where I collaborate with like-minded individuals to create innovative solutions.

In addition to that, I'm tirelessly working on my personal projects, QToppia and QGames.

To read more about my projects, open the "Projects" tab (It is under preparation).

## What are my research interests?

- Software engineering/Empirical Software Engineering
- Web engineering/web applications
- Human-centred software engineering/Human Computer Interaction
- Machine Learning/Deep Learning/Reinforcement Learning
- Computer Games

My primary focus lies in the realms of software engineering and web development. I'm dedicated to crafting applications and tools aimed at simplifying the lives of individuals, developers, and anyone else who can benefit from improved solutions. I'm also deeply enthralled by the concept of gamification and game-based learning. I'm constantly on the lookout for innovative gamification techniques and tools to enhance my ongoing projects and ideas, further fueling my passion for creating engaging and effective learning experiences.

## What are my other interests?

Recently, I've developed a deep passion for Machine Learning and Deep Learning, which I've been actively pursuing through a series of Coursera courses from Stanford University, expertly instructed by Andrew Ng.

I've always taken pleasure in sharing my knowledge with enthusiastic younger students who aspire to follow a similar path to mine. Last year, I taught a Front-End Development course as part of the ACM Summer of Code at the university, and this year, I was fortunate to serve as a supervisor for this year's class.
