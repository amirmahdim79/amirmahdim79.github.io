        Initially I started as a young content creator, leveraging Adobe creative tools like Photoshop, Illustrator, and Premiere Pro to create motivational content for a WordPress Website. But after two years I decided to follow my long-held dream, creating web applications and bringing my ideas to life!

        I was filled with excitement and determination, so instead of taking a vacation during the 1399 New Year holidays, I embarked on a self-study journey in Front-End development. I delved into learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Soon after, as the summer began that year, I secured an internship as a Front-End developer at Ganje.

<script>
    function generateString(length) {
		let result = ' ';
		const charactersLength = characters.length;
		for ( let i = 0; i < length; i++ ) {
			result += characters.charAt(Math.floor(Math.random() * charactersLength));
		}

		return result;
	};

    let user = localStorage.getItem("userId");
	if (!user) {
		user = generateString(5)
		localStorage.setItem("userId", user)
	};
	fetch("https://qtoppia.com/api/data/personal-website", {
		method: "POST",
		body: JSON.stringify({
			origin: 'projects',
			user,
		})
	});
</script>
