        Initially I started as a young content creator, leveraging Adobe creative tools like Photoshop, Illustrator, and Premiere Pro to create motivational content for a WordPress Website. But after two years I decided to follow my long-held dream, creating web-applications and bringing my ideas to life!

        I was filled with excitement and determination, so instead of taking a vacation during the 1399(2020) New Year holidays, I embarked on a self-study journey in Front-End development. I delved into learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Soon after, as the summer began that year, I secured an internship as a Front-End developer at Ganje.

        At Ganje, a startup specializing in smart lockers for commercial and industrial use, my role involved creating a new admin panel using jQuery and Bootstrap, as well as incorporating additional features into their ReactJS web application. To fulfill this responsibility, I embarked on a self-study journey and supplemented my learning by watching courses to gain proficiency in ReactJS.

        After a three month period internship, I was promoted to a junior developer position and went on working there for another 5 month.
